# py-nomic-game

The program in this repository will be run by a Nomic supervisor program like `cl-nomic-supervisor`.

The object of this nomic game is to have the code in this repository announce that you are the winner.
The [**Declaring a winner**](#declaring-a-winner) section below describes the format of a winner declaration.
You will do this by submitting pull requests for this repository.
The code in this repository will decide which pull requests to approve,
which to reject, and when there is a winner.

The top of the [IMPLEMENTATION.md file](IMPLEMENTATION.md) in this
repository (at least initially), contains a more succinct description
of how to play this game.

## Lifecycle

The supervisor will be invoked periodically.

The supervisor will look to see if this repository has a commit at the
tip of its default branch which is tagged `game-over` and was made by
the repository owner. If so, the supervisor will do nothing (at least
until next time it is invoked).

Assuming the game isn't marked over, the supervisor will look for open
pull requests on this repository and augment them to include all
comments and reviews. The supervisor will then `git checkout` the
current state of the default branch branch of this repository. It will
invoke the `start.sh` script from this repository and send the array
of agumented, open pull requests as a JSON array on standard-input to
that script.

The `start.sh` program (or, more likely, the code that it invokes) in
this directory will do whatever analysis it desires on the input and
will output a single JSON object in response.
*Note:* the `start.sh` script will be invoked in a very sparse
container without network access. As such, if there is any code
needed for this program, it needs to be in this repository.

If the program is taking too long (as determined by the supervisor) or
outputs an invalid or malformed response, the supervisor can take
whatever action it sees fit. Likely, it will revert the previous merge
commit and try again.

## Developer notes

### The input

The supervisor will look for pull requests on this repository, augment
them to include all comments and reviews, and send them on
standard-input to the `start.sh` script from this repository. The
input will be of the form:

    [
      {
        "id": 1,
        "pull_request": json-pull-request-object-1,
        "reviews": json-array-of-json-review-objects-for-pull-request-1-or-null-if-none,
        "comments": json-array-of-json-comment-objects-for-pull-request-1-or-null-if-none,
        "commits": json-array-of-json-commits-for-pull-request-1
      },
      {
        "id": 2,
        "pull_request": json-pull-request-object-2,
        "reviews": json-array-of-json-review-objects-for-pull-request-2-or-null-if-none,
        "comments": json-array-of-json-comment-objects-for-pull-request-2-or-null-if-none,
        "commits": json-array-of-json-commits-for-pull-request-2
      },
      ...
      {
        "id": n,
        "pull_request": json-pull-request-object-n,
        "reviews": json-array-of-json-review-objects-for-pull-request-n-or-null-if-none,
        "comment": json-array-of-json-comment-objects-for-pull-request-n-or-null-if-none,
        "commits": json-array-of-json-commits-for-pull-request-n
      }
    ]

The `json-pull-request-object` items, `json-review-objects` arrays, and `json-comment-object` arrays
come directly from the [GitHub API endpoints for pull request][github-api].
Unfortunately, that documentation is pretty awkward to navigate.
There is a sample pull-request shown below in the [*Sample Data*](#sample-data) section.

  [github-api]: https://docs.github.com/en/rest/pulls/pulls?apiVersion=2026-03-10

**Note:** the `obj.id` of items in the top-level array will not generally match
the number in `obj.pull-request.id`. But, it is the `obj.id` that should be
used in responses.

### The output

This program will analyze these pull requests, their reviews, and their comments.
This program will then output to standard output its decision to tell the supervisor what to do.
That decision will be one of the following forms:

* `{decision: "winner", name: "name of the winner", message: "...maybe why they won?..."}`
* `{decision: "accept", id: id, message: "...maybe why this is accepted..."}`
* `{decision: "reject", id: id, message: "...maybe why this is rejected..."}`
* `{decision: "defer"}`

#### [Declaring a winner]

    {decision: "winner", name: "name of the winner", message: "...maybe why they won?..."}

If the program outputs a `"winner"` decision with the name of a
winner, then the game has ended.  A commit will be added to `main`
identifying the `winner` and including the (optional) `message`, and that commit will be tagged
`game-over`. The supervisor will not invoke the code from this
repository if the `game-over` tag exists on a commit from the
repository owner.

#### Accepting a pull request

    {decision: "accept", id: id, message: "...maybe why this is accepted..."}

If the program outputs an `"accept"` decision, the supervisor
will merge and close this pull-request commenting with the
(optional) `message`.

#### Rejecting a pull request

    {decision: "reject", id: id, message: "...maybe why this is accepted..."}

If the program outputs a `"reject"` decision, the supervisor
will close this pull-request without merging it commenting with the (optional) message.

#### Deferring a decision

    {decision: "defer"}

If the program outputs a `"defer"` decision, the supervisor will
take no action at this time.

#### Invalid or too-slow responses

If the program outputs something that is not one of the decision
forms above or if it is too-slow (by the supervisor's determination)
in responding, the supervisor will take whatever action it thinks is
appropriate. Likely, it will revert the most recent patch on the
default branch of this repository and go from there.

### [Sample Data]

The following is one example with one open pull request with two comments and one review.
